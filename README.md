# github-auto-pull-and-run
Automatically pull github code and run a file from it every time a change is made on github. 

### Instructions:
1. Setup the tool in the config.json file
  Here you can put in the repository to clone, the language to run, as well as the file you wish to run
2. Sign into your github account through git(if not already done)
3. Install Node.js(if not already done)
4. Install the run and/or compile tools for the language you wish to run(IE install python3 for python)
5. configure github for post requests to the port you specified(for github listening) in the config.json file
  If not already done, configure your router for port forwarding
6. Run the run.bat file to run your code
7. Done!
